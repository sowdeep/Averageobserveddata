The precipitation_analyzer.py script processes Excel and CSV files to calculate column averages, specifically for yearly precipitation data.
Here's a breakdown of what it does:
It reads Excel and CSV files from a specified input folder.
It dynamically identifies columns containing year data by looking for "DAY" or "days" headers.
For each identified year column, it calculates the average of the numerical data within that column.
It also determines if a year is a leap year.
A new row containing these calculated averages is added to the original DataFrame for each processed file.
The modified files (with the average row) are saved to a processed_excel_files subfolder.
Finally, it creates a summary CSV file named all_files_years_and_averages.csv in a summary_averages subfolder, which consolidates the file name, year, calculated average, and leap year status for all processed files.
